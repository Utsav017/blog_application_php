This recipe brings you the perfect combination of flaky pastry and a flavorful filling, making every bite an indulgence.\r\n\r\nTo begin, you&#039;ll need to prepare the dough for the samosa shell. By combining all-purpose flour, a touch of salt, and a generous amount of oil or ghee, you create a crumbly texture that ensures a crisp outer layer. Add water gradually as you knead to form a firm dough, and let it rest to ensure it&#039;s pliable for shaping later.\r\n\r\nNext comes the heart of the samosa&mdash;the filling. A comforting mixture of mashed potatoes and boiled peas forms the base. This is infused with an aromatic blend of spices, including cumin seeds, grated ginger, green chilies, turmeric, and garam masala. The addition of tangy chaat masala elevates the flavor profile, making it irresistible. Lightly saut&eacute; these ingredients in oil to meld the flavors together.\r\n\r\nWith the dough rested and the filling prepared, it&#039;s time to assemble. Roll the dough into thin circles and cut them into halves. Shape each half into a cone, fill it with the spicy potato mixture, and seal it carefully to prevent any leaks while frying.\r\n\r\nThe final step is frying. Deep fry the samosas over medium heat until they turn golden brown, ensuring the crust is perfectly crispy. Serve them hot with tangy tamarind chutney or refreshing mint-coriander chutney for an authentic experience.\r\n\r\nWhether you&#039;re preparing these for a tea-time snack or a festive gathering, this ultimate samosa recipe guarantees a delightful culinary treat that&rsquo;s sure to impress! Let me know if you&#039;d like tips for frying or variations on the filling to mix things up.', '1743449391blog1.jpg', '2025-03-31 19:24:45', 1, 5, 0),
